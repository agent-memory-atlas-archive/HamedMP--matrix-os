This note is the stable integration boundary for desktop and mobile Conversation/Kanban work. The gateway and canonical workspace services remain the source of truth; shell clients render bounded projections and persist only safe selection references.

## Hydration

1. Fetch `GET /api/coding-agents/summary` and validate `RuntimeSummarySchema`.
2. Read `codingAgentsProjectWorkspace` before enabling project-first navigation.
3. Read `codingAgentsSameThreadTurns` before enabling the selected-thread composer.
4. Treat `codingAgentsConversationView` and `codingAgentsKanbanView` as additive shell capability flags.
5. Select a project from `summary.projects.items`, then fetch `GET /api/coding-agents/projects/:projectId/workspace`.

Gateway publication invariant: when the corresponding project shell surfaces are configured,
`GET /api/coding-agents/summary` emits `codingAgentsProjectWorkspace`,
`codingAgentsConversationView`, and `codingAgentsKanbanView` with availability derived from the
canonical project read model. Shells must not infer either view capability from the presence of
projects or from another capability flag.

### Mobile computer selection contract

The web shell can render the authenticated `/runtime` machine picker, but native mobile sessions
are intentionally excluded from that HTML response. Native shells consume an authenticated,
bounded JSON projection of the current Clerk user's active Matrix computers:

- `GET /api/auth/computers`, authenticated with the existing Clerk bearer token.
- `MatrixComputerListSchema`, containing only bounded safe identifiers, display labels, runtime
  slots, coarse lifecycle status, version labels, and same-origin `/vm/:handle` gateway paths.
- No public IPs, platform credentials, provider credentials, or operator-only fleet metadata may
  cross this boundary.

The native client may persist the selected same-origin gateway path, but the platform list remains
the source of truth. Switching computers must reuse the existing Clerk token provider and must
rehydrate gateway-backed state instead of copying runtime data between computers.

| Route | Auth method | Owner scope | Public |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/auth/computers` | Existing Clerk bearer token verified by the platform | Active computers owned by the authenticated Clerk user | No |

The route accepts no request body or user-controlled query input, caps the projection at 20
records, performs no external calls, and returns generic errors with `Cache-Control: no-store`.

`ProjectAgentWorkspaceSchema` is the canonical bounded navigation projection. Its `projectThreads` and `taskThreads` lists are independent; a task may own several selectable threads. Canonical task status comes from `tasks.items` and must not be inferred from thread status.

## Mutations

- Create a new project chat or task chat with `POST /api/coding-agents/threads` and `CreateAgentThreadRequestSchema`. New shell-created threads require `projectId`; `taskId` is optional but must belong to that project. `worktreeId` remains optional at this boundary: workspace-backed providers provision the deterministic server-owned worktree when it is omitted.
- Send later messages to the selected conversation with `POST /api/coding-agents/threads/:threadId/turns` and `CreateAgentTurnRequestSchema`. A 202 response is newly accepted, a 200 response is an idempotent retry, and a safe 409 means the shell should keep the current thread selected and offer retry after refresh.
- Adopt an old unassigned conversation with `POST /api/coding-agents/threads/:threadId/adopt` and `AdoptAgentThreadRequestSchema`. This compatibility route cannot move an already assigned thread.
- Keep task create/update/delete on the canonical `/api/projects/:projectId/tasks` routes. Thread state never moves a Kanban card automatically.
- Continue using the existing abort, approval-decision, and input-answer routes with a new bounded `clientRequestId` per user action.

Every persisted public thread change emits a bounded `coding-agent.thread.created`, `coding-agent.thread.updated`, or `coding-agent.thread.removed` workspace activity event in its project/task scope. Shells may use the existing authenticated workspace activity path as a refresh signal; they must re-fetch the project workspace rather than reconstructing aggregates from events.

## Conversation Replay

- Fetch `GET /api/coding-agents/threads/:threadId` for the latest bounded `AgentThreadSnapshotSchema` window.
- Fetch `GET /api/coding-agents/threads/:threadId/events?cursor=...` for bounded continuation.
- Subscribe to `/ws/coding-agents/thread/:threadId` through the existing authenticated shell client and validate every frame before reducing it.
- Render user turns only from gateway-authored `user.message` events. Provider adapters cannot emit this event type, and shells must not synthesize user transcript rows after a mutation.
- Keep the server-provided `threadId`, event cursor, and event IDs. Never store transcripts, terminal output, provider resume identity, approvals, file contents, or diffs in shell persistence.

Workspace input delivery completes the accepted turn but does not complete a still-running thread. The canonical workspace session-stop path owns terminal thread completion/failure. Shell reducers should therefore render turn and thread lifecycle independently.

### Provider-complete transcript contract gap

`AgentThreadEventSchema` currently projects assistant text, tools, approvals, input requests, and
turn/thread lifecycle, but it does not project the accepted user message. The runnable workspace
provider also starts Codex as an interactive terminal and does not normalize the provider's
structured thread/item notifications into canonical thread events. Therefore the current snapshot
route cannot represent a complete user/assistant transcript for a real Codex session.

Transcript parity requires a gateway-owned provider ingestion adapter that:

- emits a bounded canonical user-message event when a create/turn command is accepted;
- maps structured provider thread, turn, assistant-message, reasoning, tool, approval, and input
  notifications into `AgentThreadEventSchema` without exposing raw provider payloads;
- persists those events in the existing owner-scoped thread store and publishes them through the
  existing snapshot, continuation, and WebSocket routes; and
- defines backward pagination for history older than the latest bounded snapshot window.

Until that adapter and schema extension exist, shells must label the current view as an activity
timeline and must not claim provider-complete transcript support.

### Project/chat terminal relation contract

The project-scoped terminal workspace contract is authoritative. Runtime summaries expose bounded
workspace and tab rows, while thread creation, thread summaries, and `terminal.bound` events carry a
`terminalRef` containing the stable `workspaceId` and `tabId`. Each project owns one workspace and
each tab can be associated with a task or thread without making that conversation the tab owner.

Shells group tabs by the gateway-provided project workspace and attach only through the referenced
workspace/tab pair. They do not infer relationships from Zellij names, working directories, the
selected chat, or local persistence. Mutations validate owner, project, task, and thread scope at
the gateway and publish a generic project refresh event after commit.

## Error And Recovery Rules

- Render only allowlisted bounded `safeMessage` values; use a generic refresh/retry fallback for unknown client errors.
- On runtime switch or foreground resume, re-fetch summary and reconcile selected project/task/thread IDs against live projections.
- A missing selected thread is recoverable navigation state, not proof that the provider or runtime failed.
- Provider credentials, bearer credentials, server-only resume identity, filesystem paths, and raw provider errors never cross into shell state.

## Focused Backend Validation

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run tests/contracts/coding-agent*.test.ts tests/gateway/coding-agent*.test.ts tests/gateway/workspace-event-publisher.test.ts tests/gateway/workspace-events.test.ts tests/gateway/workspace-routes.test.ts tests/gateway/workspace-session-orchestrator.test.ts tests/gateway/zellij-runtime.test.ts tests/gateway/agent-session-manager.test.ts
pnpm --filter @matrix-os/gateway exec tsc --noEmit
bun run check:patterns
bun run typecheck
```

For deterministic local UI development, set `MATRIX_CODING_AGENTS_FAKE_PROVIDER=1` in the gateway environment. Real workspace execution remains separately flag-controlled and should not be required to build or test shell navigation, loading, empty, busy, retry, and replay states.
