# Coding Agents Across OS Views

This guide documents the Matrix OS coding-agent architecture across Electron Desktop, Web Desktop, Web Canvas, Native Mobile, and Web Mobile. The gateway/runtime remains the source of truth; clients are resumable OS views that render validated summaries and snapshots.

## Ownership Boundaries

- Shared contracts live in `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` and are the only supported cross-surface shape for runtime summaries, providers, threads, events, approvals, terminal summaries, review snapshots, file reads, and preview summaries.
- Gateway owns coding-agent read models, provider adapters, thread state, event replay, approval decisions, input answers, terminal binding, review/file adapters, preview summaries, and safe error mapping.
- Desktop main process owns bearer-authenticated gateway calls. Renderer code receives only Zod-validated, bounded data over typed IPC and must not receive bearer tokens or provider credentials.
- Mobile uses the authenticated `GatewayClient` and may persist only bounded UI references such as selected IDs and timestamps. Do not persist transcripts, terminal output, file contents, diffs, raw approval payloads, credentials, or launch tokens.
- Web OS views call authenticated gateway routes and validate shared contracts before rendering. Renderer-only filtering is defensive; project and owner scoping must happen in the gateway before list bounds are applied.
- Canonical terminals are `TerminalRef` values under `/api/terminal/workspaces/:workspaceId/tabs/:tabId` and `/ws/terminal/tab`. Coding agents bind to that same owner-scoped model; legacy session routes are upgrade errors, not compatibility paths.

## Web OS Views

Web Desktop is the default browser presentation and Web Canvas is a launcher-accessible free-form presentation over the same coding-agent state. Neither renderer owns coding-agent runtime state. Coding-agent entry points use the canonical Chat, Terminal, Files, and review surfaces rather than a Workspace app or Workspace Canvas. Source-control mutations, transcripts, file contents, diffs, and provider setup remain governed by gateway contracts and the applicable trusted client boundary.

## Mobile Agent Cockpit

The mobile Agents landing screen is a thin projection of the bounded gateway runtime summary:

- Needs attention contains approval-required, input-required, and failed threads.
- Working contains queued, starting, and running threads.
- Recent keeps every completed, aborted, recoverable stale, or archived thread from the contract-bounded runtime lists reachable through the canonical thread-detail route. A `completed` attention value also belongs here.
- Duplicate ids across `activeThreads` and `attentionThreads` render once. Gateway timestamps determine ordering; mobile does not infer task status from thread status.
- Working rows use static status marks. Pull-to-refresh reconciles the summary, so a row must not show a perpetual live spinner unless a future implementation adds an actual bounded stream or polling lifecycle.

Use `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="automatic"` on the route scroll view and plain content padding. Do not add `react-native-unistyles` runtime safe-area values to the same top or bottom padding, because iOS already applies those insets.

Cockpit projection state remains in memory. Mobile storage may contain validated bounded selection references or drafts only, never runtime summaries, transcripts, terminal output, files, diffs, credentials, or approval payloads.

The mobile new-run composer must bind every newly created chat to one available
`RuntimeSummarySchema.projects` item. It may carry a validated optional task id
from a canonical task route, but switching projects clears that task relation.
When no available project exists, including summaries with only stale or
missing rows, the empty state creates a scratch project or imports a GitHub
repository through canonical `POST /api/coding-agents/projects`, validates the
returned project id, then refreshes the runtime summary before enabling thread
submission. The thread request uses that canonical project id and optional task id; it must
not create a new unassigned thread. Explicit stale project links remain
unselected and require recovery instead of being silently remapped. Project
form values and mutation results remain transient and never enter AsyncStorage.

## Gateway Routes

The coding-agent route module is `packages/gateway/src/coding-agents/routes.ts`, mounted under `/api/coding-agents`.

- `GET /summary` returns `RuntimeSummarySchema` and accepts an optional validated `projectId` query for project-scoped preview summaries.
- `POST /projects` creates a scratch project or imports a GitHub project idempotently and returns only a bounded project summary.
- `POST /threads` creates or returns an idempotent thread by `clientRequestId`.
- `GET /threads`, `GET /threads/:threadId`, and `GET /threads/:threadId/events` return bounded summaries or snapshots.
- `POST /threads/:threadId/abort` aborts idempotently.
- `POST /threads/:threadId/approvals/:approvalId/decision` records an idempotent approval decision.
- `POST /threads/:threadId/inputs/:inputRequestId/answer` records a bounded user-input answer.
- `GET /reviews` and `GET /reviews/:reviewId` expose bounded review summaries and snapshots.
- `GET /files/read` exposes bounded owner-checkout text snapshots. Omitting `worktreeId` reads the project's primary checkout; providing it scopes the read to that worktree.
- `GET /notification-preferences` returns coding-agent notification preferences for the authenticated owner.
- `PUT /notification-preferences` updates coding-agent notification preferences for the authenticated owner with a small body limit and atomic per-owner file persistence.

Every mutating route needs auth, `bodyLimit`, Zod validation, an ownership check, safe error mapping, and focused tests.

An agent thread may omit `worktreeId` to run in the validated owner project's primary checkout. Supplying `worktreeId` keeps the existing isolated worktree behavior. Both paths pass through the same gateway-owned sandbox preflight and terminal binding.

## Event Model

Thread events are validated by `AgentThreadEventSchema`. Reducers should treat the union as append-only input:

- Ignore unknown future event types instead of crashing.
- Use `event.id` for idempotency when replay and live stream overlap.
- Keep transcript rendering bounded in the client. Long-lived event history belongs in gateway-owned thread state, not in shell persistence.
- Render approval, input, file-change, review-ready, terminal-bound, safe-error, and completion events from their typed payloads only.

When adding an event type:

1. Add the schema to `AgentThreadEventSchema` with bounded payload fields.
2. Add contract tests for valid and invalid payloads.
3. Teach `thread-store` replay/summary derivation how the event affects status, attention, and terminal binding.
4. Update desktop/mobile reducers to ignore or render the new event without breaking older snapshots.
5. Add stream replay tests that prove replay plus live delivery remains idempotent.

## Provider Adapters

Provider-specific behavior belongs behind the gateway provider adapter interface, not in desktop or mobile UI. A provider adapter should:

- Normalize start, abort, status, tool activity, approvals, input requests, and completion into shared thread events.
- Enforce timeouts or `AbortSignal` on external calls.
- Return generic client errors while logging provider details server-side only.
- Log coding-agent gateway failures through `logCodingAgentWarning()` from
  `packages/gateway/src/coding-agents/diagnostics.ts` so server diagnostics keep
  coarse scope and error type while redacting tokens, owner paths, URLs, private
  hosts, and database details.
- Use foreground terminal setup actions when user interaction is required.
- Avoid provider-specific branches in shell components unless the shared contract explicitly exposes safe metadata.

Provider executable discovery does not imply protocol compatibility. Codex
support uses checked-in exec JSONL and app-server manifests with one bounded
installed-version range. The daily `Codex Provider Contracts` workflow resolves
the latest published package, verifies both protocol digests, and fails on
version or schema drift. Runtime capabilities must remain disabled for any
installed version outside the verified range; do not silently fall back to raw
terminal parsing for approvals or structured input.

App-server requests must pass through the gateway's bounded request normalizer.
Command, file-change, and permission requests use Matrix-authored generic copy;
raw commands, paths, hosts, and permission payloads never enter thread events.
Structured questions retain only validated display fields and Matrix-generated
question ids. Native JSON-RPC ids and provider thread, turn, item, and question
ids are control-runtime state and must never cross HTTP, WebSocket, IPC, push,
or persisted shell contracts.

The gateway provider registry owns shell-facing provider projections. It validates the bounded configured adapter set at startup, validates and bounds owner-scoped credential responses, combines adapter metadata with that credential state, and keeps credential-known non-system providers visible even before an execution adapter is registered. Credential-only projections preserve coarse install/auth state but remain unavailable for runs until an adapter exists. Credential-source failures fail closed to unavailable/unknown adapter projections without running setup or health reads. Adapter reads receive timeout signals, and only coarse health booleans enter a capped owner/provider TTL cache with LRU eviction. Invalid summaries or setup actions degrade to generic safe state; raw health output and credentials never enter the runtime summary.

Workspace provider projections are configured with the bounded, comma-separated `MATRIX_CODING_AGENTS_WORKSPACE_PROVIDERS` setting. The supported rollout values are `claude`, `codex`, and `pi`; duplicates, unknown values, empty entries, and more than three entries fail startup with a generic configuration error. Every explicitly configured Claude/Codex adapter enters both the registry and executable provider sets. Customer host bundles explicitly enable the Claude and Codex adapters with `MATRIX_CODING_AGENTS_WORKSPACE_PROVIDERS=claude,codex` so authenticated users can execute either provider; provider readiness still fails closed until the selected provider CLI is installed and connected. The legacy `MATRIX_CODING_AGENTS_WORKSPACE_PROVIDER=1` setting remains a Codex-only compatibility path when the explicit list is unset, and an explicitly empty provider list disables workspace providers even when the legacy setting is present.

Claude execution uses a session-only inline policy and passes `--setting-sources ""`, so user, project, and local settings cannot broaden the gateway-owned launch policy. A bounded `--init-only` call with a five-second timeout verifies the real installed CLI and requested policy before zellij or session persistence. Prompted thread launches add `--print`, using the CLI's documented non-interactive path so a first-use workspace trust prompt cannot stall a remote run; no-prompt foreground terminal launches remain interactive. Sandboxed launches set `failIfUnavailable`, disable unsandboxed command escape, and scope writes to the canonical owner worktree plus session scratch directory. Read-only, plan, and review launches deny the built-in Edit, Write, and NotebookEdit tools and block subprocess writes to both the checkout and its shared Git metadata directory. Stale unowned scratch directories become reclaimable after 30 minutes on a later preflight, while active and degraded session state prevents reclamation. Explicit full-access launches disable the OS sandbox and retain the requested permission behavior. Sandboxed workspace `on_request` and `never` map to `dontAsk` with scoped `Edit(...)` allow rules that cover all built-in file-edit tools; unmatched paths are auto-denied. `untrusted` retains permission mode `default`, and `on_failure` fails closed because Claude has no equivalent enforceable mode. Managed and self-hosted runtime foundations install bubblewrap and socat. Ubuntu 24.04 and newer hosts also receive the required `bwrap` AppArmor profile; the developer-tools service reconciles these prerequisites after in-place host-bundle updates. Missing or incompatible dependencies return only a generic sandbox-unavailable error to shells.

Pi (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) is an executable direct-spawn adapter, not a terminal session: each turn runs `pi --mode json --print --no-approve --session-id <uuid> <prompt>` and the NDJSON stream is normalized into thread events (assistant text, tool started/output/completed, safe failure/abort mapping). Turns resume through the exact `--session-id`; because pi scopes sessions to the process cwd, the provider resume state carries both the session id and the resolved workspace path. Pi executes tools without interactive approvals in print mode, so approval and user-input requests are unsupported and setup stays foreground-terminal based (install package, then `pi` for its interactive `/login`).

Claude and Codex workspace adapters expose only fixed server-owned foreground setup actions. Every setup action defaults `MATRIX_NODE_PREFIX` to the canonical `/opt/matrix/runtime/node` prefix and prepends `$MATRIX_NODE_PREFIX/bin` to `PATH` before invoking a provider command. Install actions run the existing npm package install in a visible terminal, connect actions launch the provider's interactive local login flow, and both leave an interactive shell open afterward. Commands are bounded by `SafeSetupActionSchema`; clients must not render command text, persist it, or accept client-supplied replacements.

Desktop project-chat composers derive readiness only from the validated runtime summary. A send is allowed only when the selected new-chat provider, or the existing thread's stored provider, is explicitly `available`, `installed`, and `authenticated`. Missing, setup-required, auth-required, expired, installing, unsupported, unknown, and summary-check failure states all fail closed. The blocked composer remains editable and keeps its draft, but button and keyboard submission must not invoke a thread mutation. Recovery renders the server-owned safe setup action in a foreground terminal, or a summary refresh when no setup action is appropriate; the shell must re-read readiness before sending and must not infer success from a terminal opening.

When adding a provider:

1. Add a provider summary state through the provider registry.
2. Add safe setup actions and health behavior with capped TTL cache state.
3. Add a provider adapter test using the fake or deterministic workspace path first.
4. Add thread-create tests for success, missing auth/setup, abort, failure, and safe error mapping.
5. Keep the provider behind a feature flag until end-to-end shell validation passes.

## Terminal Binding

Coding-agent threads may point at a canonical terminal session using bounded terminal identifiers. The binding rules are:

Cross-surface input, presentation, and canonical-size ownership follow
[Terminal session ownership](./terminal-session-ownership.md). In particular,
local command-line handoff uses `matrix shell connect --project <project> --tab <tab>`; raw
`zellij attach` is not a coordinated Matrix client.

- Workspace orchestration owns `/api/sessions`; terminal processes live in project-scoped terminal workspaces and tabs. The gateway reaches the separate host runtime over its protected Unix socket, while legacy terminal session routes return `426 client_upgrade_required`.

- Thread snapshots can expose attachable terminal references, not raw PTY output.
- Desktop should open the existing Terminal surface for the bound `TerminalRef`.
- Mobile should hand off to the same `TerminalRef` while keeping its selected tab local to the device.
- Detach must not end the underlying process.
- Stale or ended terminal references should render recoverable UI and refresh summary state.

Do not store terminal output in mobile AsyncStorage or desktop renderer persistence.

## Approval And Input Flow

Approval and input requests are gateway-owned lifecycle events.

- The provider emits an approval or input event with bounded preview text.
- Desktop/mobile render the request from the thread snapshot or stream.
- Mobile thread details pin the newest unresolved approval or input request above the timeline while keeping the timeline as the audit trail.
- A shell submits a decision or answer with a bounded `clientRequestId`.
- Gateway applies the first valid decision idempotently, appends the resolution event, and broadcasts it.
- Other shells update from the returned snapshot or stream event.

Structured provider input may carry up to eight bounded questions with stable
question ids, optional choices, and free-form or secret-entry metadata. New
clients submit the bounded `structuredAnswers` map and also include the existing
legacy `answer` fallback for wire compatibility. Provider adapters must prefer
the structured map, verify every question id against the pending request, and
must not append answer values to thread events, logs, notifications, or shell
persistence.

Client UI must disable duplicate submission while a decision is in flight and recover by rehydrating the thread snapshot on failure. User-facing errors should be generic and recovery-oriented.

Mobile thread detail should rehydrate its current bounded thread snapshot when the app returns to the foreground so pending approval and input state reconciles with decisions made from other shells. This refresh must use the authenticated gateway client and must not persist approval payloads, input text, transcripts, or terminal output.

Mobile approval and input action handling lives in `apps/mobile/lib/agent-thread-actions.ts`. Keep the route responsible for hydration, streaming, navigation, and render composition; keep transient pending action ids, bounded action errors, input drafts, idempotency request ids, and accepted-snapshot haptic guards inside that hook. The hook must only act on the current route thread id, and success haptics must wait until the gateway-returned bounded snapshot has been accepted by the route.

Desktop thread timelines may group `assistant.text.delta` and `assistant.text.completed` events by bounded `messageId`, plus `tool.started`, `tool.output`, and `tool.completed` events by bounded `toolCallId`, for readability. Grouped assistant rows may render a capped assistant text preview only when the joined deltas pass local safe-display filtering; otherwise they must fall back to update counts and completion state. Grouped tool rows must render only safe display metadata, output presence/truncation, and completion state. Never render message ids, tool call ids, sensitive-looking assistant text, or raw tool output.

Mobile thread timelines may group `assistant.text.delta` and `assistant.text.completed` events by bounded `messageId` for readability. Grouped rows may render a capped assistant text preview only when the joined deltas pass local safe-display filtering; otherwise they must fall back to update counts and completion state. Never render message ids or sensitive-looking assistant text.

Mobile thread timelines may group `tool.started`, `tool.output`, and `tool.completed` events by `toolCallId` for readability. Grouped rows must render only safe tool display metadata, coarse output presence/truncation, and completion outcome; never render raw tool output text.

Desktop thread streams are owned by the trusted main process. The renderer asks
for `runtime:subscribe-thread-events`, receives only validated
`runtime:thread-event` payloads, and never receives bearer credentials or WS
tokens. Runtime switches and window shutdown must close active desktop stream
subscriptions.

## Attention Notifications

Coding-agent attention notifications are gateway-owned. Thread events for approval requests, user-input requests, failed runs, and successful completion may emit safe push-channel payloads with generic copy plus a bounded thread id. The bridge deduplicates owner/thread/kind notifications in a capped TTL registry and checks owner notification preferences before sending. Missing preferences, including legacy preference files without the completion key, default to enabled; corrupt or unavailable preferences must fail closed for push delivery and log details server-side only.

Push delivery is owner-scoped and cross-device by policy: a valid attention push fans out to the authenticated owner's active registered push tokens, not to other owners. The push adapter caps owner buckets and per-owner registered tokens, evicts only the oldest registrations for the same owner when that owner reaches the per-owner cap, drops stale token registrations before delivery, deduplicates token values, and caps per-notification fanout to the newest active devices so device growth cannot create an unbounded send batch.

Desktop and mobile may expose controls for approval, input, failed-run, and completion attention push preferences. Desktop must route reads and writes through trusted main-process IPC so bearer credentials stay out of the renderer. Mobile must use the authenticated gateway client and keep preference state transient; do not persist notification preference payloads in AsyncStorage. Preference updates are full replacements validated with `CodingAgentNotificationPreferencesUpdateSchema`.

Desktop badge counts may include `RuntimeSummary.attentionThreads.items.length` when the bounded list is complete. If `attentionThreads.hasMore` is true, the badge should use its overflow cap instead of guessing a total. The gateway summary remains the source of truth; do not mirror coding-agent attention state into a separate desktop-owned registry.

## Client State Rules

Desktop renderer stores may cache selected IDs, panel state, and validated summaries. They must not cache credentials, raw provider errors, terminal output, file contents beyond the current read-only render state, or unbounded transcripts.

Mobile state must stay smaller:

- Allowed: selected thread/review/preview/session IDs, route names, timestamps, small UI flags.
- Not allowed: transcripts, terminal output, file contents, diffs, raw approval payloads, provider credentials, launch tokens, internal paths, private hostnames.

Browser shell state follows the same UI-reference rule and must rehydrate from gateway state on project/runtime changes.

## Security Checklist

Use this checklist for every coding-agent shell PR:

- Shared contract boundary uses `zod/v4`.
- Route params, query params, request bodies, IPC payloads, WebSocket frames, and persisted client state are validated.
- Mutating HTTP routes use `bodyLimit`.
- Every external call has a timeout or `AbortSignal`.
- Every in-memory `Map` or `Set` has a cap and eviction policy.
- WebSocket auth completes before success frames, frame size is capped, subscribers are capped, stale subscribers are swept, and shutdown drains subscribers.
- Lists are bounded before response.
- Errors sent to clients are generic and safe.
- Server diagnostics for coding-agent routes, summary adapters, streams,
  provider lifecycle, and notification bridges use the bounded redacted
  diagnostic helper instead of raw `err.message` logging.
- Mobile coding-agent gateway client diagnostics use
  `apps/mobile/lib/coding-agent-diagnostics.ts` for bounded warning scope and
  redacted metadata. Do not log raw gateway response bodies, filesystem paths,
  private hosts, bearer tokens, provider errors, or database details from mobile
  gateway clients.
- Desktop renderer never receives bearer credentials or provider credentials.
- Mobile AsyncStorage contains only bounded safe references.
- Terminal/session behavior reuses canonical Matrix terminal primitives.
- No new embedded persistence is introduced.

## Operator Runbook

Use this section when a coding-agent shell surface is enabled but a user cannot continue work from desktop or mobile. Keep support notes public-safe: do not paste customer identifiers, bearer tokens, provider credentials, private hostnames, VPS IPs, or raw provider output into GitHub, docs, or PR comments.

### Provider Setup Failure

Symptoms:

- The workspace shows a provider as missing, setup required, auth required, or unavailable.
- Starting a thread returns a generic setup or provider-unavailable message.
- The foreground setup terminal exits before the provider becomes available.

Checks:

1. Confirm the runtime summary is reachable through the authenticated gateway route and that `providers` contains the affected provider with a safe install/auth state.
2. Confirm the provider setup action opens a foreground terminal session instead of a hidden background job.
3. Confirm the user completed the provider's own CLI login flow inside the Matrix computer, not by pasting credentials into chat or docs.
4. Confirm the provider registry returns a generic client state while logging detailed setup failure server-side.
5. If the setup action repeatedly fails, leave the thread or provider in a recoverable setup-required state and record a follow-up with sanitized evidence.

Do not fix provider setup by moving credentials into desktop renderer state, mobile storage, shell query params, or PR comments.

### Runtime Offline Or Unavailable

Symptoms:

- Desktop or mobile shows an unavailable runtime summary.
- Thread, review, file, or preview panels show empty safe fallback states.
- A runtime switch leaves stale thread or terminal references visible.

Checks:

1. Verify the selected Matrix computer is the intended runtime before inspecting shell UI state.
2. Check the authenticated `/api/coding-agents/summary` path from the gateway side and confirm failures map to `SafeClientErrorSchema`.
3. Rehydrate the shell from gateway state after runtime switch; do not rely on persisted desktop/mobile references as source of truth.
4. Confirm stale thread, terminal, review, and preview references are dropped or rendered as recoverable.
5. Confirm user-visible messages do not include provider raw errors, stack traces, filesystem paths, private hostnames, VPS IPs, or database errors.

### Thread Or Event Stream Recovery

Symptoms:

- A thread detail opens but misses recent events.
- Mobile or desktop shows duplicated deltas after reconnect.
- Approval or input resolution appears stuck in one shell.

Checks:

1. Fetch the thread snapshot over HTTP first; the snapshot is the recovery path when a stream is stale.
2. Confirm replay cursors are bounded and the reducer deduplicates by event id.
3. Confirm desktop streams are opened by the main process through a short-lived WS token, while mobile streams use the authenticated gateway client.
4. Confirm the WebSocket authenticates before success, validates frame shapes, and reports a safe replay gap when history is no longer available.
5. Confirm approval and input decisions use bounded `clientRequestId` values and are idempotent.
6. If one shell stays stale, force a thread snapshot refresh before asking the user to repeat the action.

### Terminal Binding Recovery

Symptoms:

- A thread shows a terminal reference that no longer attaches.
- Mobile opens Terminal but the bound session is gone.
- Desktop and mobile disagree about whether a terminal is running.

Checks:

1. Treat the canonical terminal/session registry as source of truth.
2. If a bound session is missing or exited, render a recoverable stale state and refresh the runtime summary.
3. Do not create a coding-agent-only terminal model or duplicate terminal persistence.
4. Confirm detach does not terminate the process and terminate does update summaries.
5. Confirm mobile did not persist terminal output or replay buffers.

### Review, File, And Diff Recovery

Symptoms:

- A review snapshot is partial.
- A selected file cannot be opened.
- Large diffs are truncated or hunk lines are missing.

Checks:

1. Partial review snapshots are expected for large, binary, moved, unsafe, or unavailable files.
2. File reads must stay inside the validated owner worktree root and reject traversal and symlinks.
3. The UI should show changed-file metadata and recovery copy instead of raw paths or command output.
4. Follow-up prompts should carry structured references, not full file contents or unbounded diffs.
5. Mobile must reload file content from the gateway and must not persist file bytes.

### Preview Recovery

Symptoms:

- A preview row appears without an open action.
- A preview from another project appears missing.
- Opening a preview fails after a runtime or project switch.

Checks:

1. Project-scoped preview requests should be filtered before gateway list bounds are applied.
2. HTTPS origins may open directly; local HTTP origins should remain status-only unless the shell can safely attach to the local runtime.
3. Preview summaries must not include paths, query strings, tokens, internal hostnames, or provider logs.
4. Runtime or project switches should clear stale preview rows before new data loads.
5. If a preview is stale, refresh the runtime summary rather than trusting a persisted client reference.

### Desktop Validation

Before enabling a desktop coding-agent shell change broadly:

1. Run the touched desktop unit or renderer tests and `pnpm --filter desktop run typecheck`.
2. When the slice touches shared shell, gateway, or contract behavior, also run the matching gateway Vitest tests, shell typecheck, and desktop operator smoke listed below.
3. Confirm desktop renderer state and IPC payloads contain only validated summaries, snapshots, and bounded UI references. Bearer credentials, provider credentials, raw provider errors, terminal output, file contents beyond transient editor state, and unbounded transcripts must stay out of renderer persistence.
4. Run the Manual Desktop Real-Runtime Smoke checklist below when the slice touches runtime switching, native menu or command-palette entry points, Agents workspace routing, provider setup actions, thread detail, approval/input controls, review/file/preview routes, notification click-through, desktop badge counts, or terminal binding.
5. Confirm Terminal Shells, Apps, Settings, Chat, hosted shell embeds, updater entry points, deep links, and window/menu behavior still work after the Agents pass.

#### Automated Desktop Preflight

Use the smallest focused set for the touched surface first. These are the current desktop coding-agent gates:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run tests/desktop/coding-agent-runtime-client.test.ts tests/desktop/coding-agent-thread-stream.test.ts tests/desktop/coding-agent-workspace.test.tsx tests/desktop/ipc-contract.test.ts
pnpm exec vitest run tests/desktop/menu-template.test.ts tests/desktop/shortcuts.test.ts tests/desktop/command-palette.test.tsx
pnpm --filter desktop run typecheck
```

If the slice changes the desktop end-to-end shell path, also run:

```bash
xvfb-run -a bun run test:e2e tests/e2e/desktop/operator.e2e.test.ts
```

For release-parity packaging or trusted main-process changes, add:

```bash
bun run build:desktop
```

### Manual Desktop Real-Runtime Smoke

Use this checklist against a real Matrix computer before broad rollout of
desktop coding-agent shell changes. Keep evidence public-safe: do not paste
bearer tokens, provider credentials, private hostnames, VPS IPs, raw provider
output, terminal output, transcripts, file contents, diffs, approval payloads,
launch tokens, or customer identifiers.

1. Launch the desktop app from the branch or packaged artifact under test, sign
   in, and select the intended Matrix computer. If multiple runtimes are
   available, switch runtimes once and confirm Agents rehydrates from the newly
   selected runtime.
2. Open Agents from the sidebar, command palette, and native menu or shortcut.
   Confirm each entry point focuses the same gateway-backed workspace instead
   of a legacy local composer.
3. Confirm the workspace hydrates provider status, active threads, attention
   threads, terminal summaries, review summaries, and preview summaries from
   the gateway without raw errors.
4. If a provider requires setup, use the foreground setup action. Confirm it
   opens a canonical terminal session and does not expose setup commands,
   credentials, or provider raw errors in renderer state or screenshots.
5. Before provider recovery, confirm both a new-chat draft and a stored-thread
   follow-up remain editable, keep their text, show a visible recovery notice,
   and invoke no create/turn mutation from either the Send button or Enter.
   Complete the real provider setup, refresh readiness, and confirm the same
   drafts remain present until explicitly sent.
6. Open an existing thread, or create a disposable test thread only when a
   provider is ready. Confirm one new chat and one follow-up each produce an
   accepted gateway turn, the detail snapshot loads, event grouping is bounded,
   stream updates do not duplicate replayed events, and unresolved approval/input
   controls stay idempotent while a request is in flight.
7. Use a bound terminal action from Agents or thread detail. Confirm it opens
   the existing Terminal tab/model for the canonical Matrix terminal session;
   detaching or leaving the tab must not terminate the underlying process.
8. Open review, file, and preview surfaces. Confirm review/file content loads
   through trusted IPC, file edits remain transient until saved through the
   gateway, large/partial data shows recoverable UI, HTTPS previews open through
   safe desktop open paths, and failures remain generic.
9. Trigger or simulate a coding-agent attention notification with a bounded
   thread reference. Confirm clicking the native notification focuses the
   Agents workspace and visibly selects the matching thread. Confirm the badge
   count reflects bounded gateway-owned attention state and uses overflow
   behavior when the list is truncated.
10. Put the runtime in an unavailable or offline state, or switch away from it,
   then return. Confirm stale thread, terminal, review, and preview references
   are dropped or shown as recoverable, and the UI rehydrates from the gateway
   instead of trusting local renderer state.
11. Recheck Terminal Shells, Apps, Settings, Chat, hosted shell embeds, updater
    entry points, deep links, native menus, shortcuts, and window restore after
    the Agents pass.
12. Record branch, commit, desktop app build type, selected validation commands,
    pass/fail notes, and any deferred manual step with the automated or manual
    coverage that still applies.

### Mobile Validation

Before enabling a mobile coding-agent shell change broadly:

1. Run the touched mobile Jest tests and `pnpm --filter matrix-os-mobile exec tsc --noEmit`.
2. When the slice touches shared shell, gateway, or contract behavior, also run the matching gateway Vitest tests, shell typecheck, and the shell/mobile readiness tests listed in `docs/dev/mobile-shell.md`.
3. Confirm mobile persisted state contains only bounded UI references.
4. Run the Coding-Agent SDK 57 Device Smoke checklist in `docs/dev/mobile-shell.md` when the slice touches Agents workspace routing, thread detail, approval/input controls, review/file detail, preview routes, bound terminal routes, notification tap routing, offline/reconnect handling, or mobile persistence.
5. Confirm Chat, Apps, Terminal, and Settings tabs still open.
6. Keep the existing terminal fallback. Do not land native terminal replacement behavior without separate device validation.

### Real Runtime Smoke

Use the opt-in smoke helper after a coding-agent shell stack is deployed to a Matrix runtime and before treating desktop/mobile validation as complete:

```bash
MATRIX_RUNTIME_URL="https://app.matrix-os.com/vm/<handle>" \
MATRIX_RUNTIME_TOKEN="<short-lived runtime token>" \
node scripts/coding-agents/real-runtime-smoke.mjs
```

The helper performs read-only authenticated checks for `GET /api/coding-agents/summary`, `GET /api/coding-agents/threads`, `GET /api/coding-agents/reviews`, and `GET /api/coding-agents/notification-preferences`. It validates bounded response contracts with Zod 4, applies per-request timeouts, caps response bodies, and redacts bearer tokens from logs.

Add read-only assertions when the deployed runtime is expected to expose specific coding-agent surfaces:

```bash
MATRIX_RUNTIME_URL="https://app.matrix-os.com/vm/<handle>" \
MATRIX_RUNTIME_TOKEN="<short-lived runtime token>" \
node scripts/coding-agents/real-runtime-smoke.mjs \
  --require-capability codingAgentsRuntimeSummary \

Available assertion flags are `--require-capability <id>`, `--require-ready-provider`, `--require-thread-snapshot`, `--min-active-threads <count>`, `--min-terminal-tabs <count>`, `--min-preview-sessions <count>`, and `--min-reviews <count>`. The helper remains read-only; it follows review cursors only when a minimum review count is requested and validates a thread snapshot only when `--require-thread-snapshot` is passed.

Do not paste live token values, raw response bodies, transcripts, terminal output, file contents, diffs, provider errors, private hostnames, or VPS IPs into PR comments. Record only the command shape, pass/fail status, and sanitized recovery notes.

## Validation Commands

Run the smallest focused tests for the touched surface, then the shared gates that apply:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run tests/scripts/coding-agent-real-runtime-smoke.test.ts
pnpm exec vitest run tests/contracts/coding-agents.test.ts tests/gateway/coding-agents-summary.test.ts
pnpm --filter desktop run typecheck
pnpm --dir apps/mobile exec jest --runInBand
pnpm --filter matrix-os-mobile exec tsc --noEmit
bun run test tests/shell/terminal-app-component.test.tsx tests/shell/mobile-shell.test.tsx tests/shell/mobile-canvas.test.tsx tests/shell/user-button-hydration.test.tsx tests/shell/app-launch.test.ts tests/shell/app-viewer-slug.test.ts
bun run test tests/gateway/terminal-ws.test.ts
pnpm --dir shell exec tsc --noEmit
bun run check:patterns
bun run typecheck
git diff --check
```

For mobile-only changes, prefer the mobile Jest command for touched tests first. For shared shell, gateway, or contract changes, keep the shell/mobile readiness commands in the block. For gateway routes/services/contracts, use focused Vitest tests before broad typecheck.
