# Agent Matrix Skills

Matrix ships an Agent-installable skill pack under `skills/matrix/`. These skills teach Agent how to build and debug Matrix apps, use the Matrix design system, work with Matrix integrations, and operate on a dev VPS.

`skills/matrix/` is the source of truth for Matrix-hosted coding agents. Runtime sync projects every skill directory with a `SKILL.md` into the tool-specific locations for Matrix, Claude Code, Codex, and Hermes.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `matrix-app-builder` | Build Matrix apps as Vite React TypeScript projects with `matrix.json` and verified `dist/` output. |
| `matrix-app-ui-patterns` | Build stable app interiors for windowed, mobile, dashboard, data, and canvas contexts. |
| `matrix-design-system` | Apply Matrix theme, shadcn-style component patterns, icon quality rules, and iframe-safe app layouts. |
| `matrix-integrations` | Use platform-owned Matrix integrations without copying provider secrets into Agent or customer VPSes. |
| `matrix-dev-vps` | Develop Matrix from inside a user/dev VPS with hot reload, previews, and auth-aware tunnels. |
| `matrix-debug-app` | Fix `needs_build`, manifest problems, bundle/icon 404s, console errors, and integration proxy issues. |
| `matrix-landing-design` | Build public Matrix OS marketing and landing surfaces without mixing those patterns into apps. |

## Install Into Agent

### One Command

From a Matrix checkout:

```bash
./scripts/install-agent-matrix-skills.sh
```

The script installs the shipped Matrix app skills from `HamedMP/matrix-os` by default. To install from a local path or another tap/source:

```bash
./scripts/install-agent-matrix-skills.sh /home/matrix/projects/matrix-os
MATRIX_SKILLS_SOURCE=HamedMP/matrix-os ./scripts/install-agent-matrix-skills.sh
AGENT_BIN=/opt/matrix/runtime/node/bin/agent ./scripts/install-agent-matrix-skills.sh
```

Equivalent manual command:

```bash
for skill in app-builder app-ui-patterns design-system integrations dev-vps debug-app landing-design; do
  agent skills install "HamedMP/matrix-os/skills/matrix/$skill"
done
```

### Manual Install

From a running Agent environment with GitHub skill install support:

```bash
agent skills install HamedMP/matrix-os/skills/matrix/app-builder
agent skills install HamedMP/matrix-os/skills/matrix/app-ui-patterns
agent skills install HamedMP/matrix-os/skills/matrix/design-system
agent skills install HamedMP/matrix-os/skills/matrix/integrations
agent skills install HamedMP/matrix-os/skills/matrix/dev-vps
agent skills install HamedMP/matrix-os/skills/matrix/debug-app
agent skills install HamedMP/matrix-os/skills/matrix/landing-design
```

If Agent is running from a local checkout, install from the local path or add the repo as a tap:

```bash
agent skills tap add HamedMP/matrix-os
agent skills browse matrix
```

## Codex Plugin

Matrix also exposes the repo-scoped **Matrix OS** Codex marketplace product at
`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. It helps a local Codex set up and recover a Matrix cloud
computer, run bounded commands or coding-agent tasks, and safely clone or modify GitHub projects.
The plugin ID and installed skill namespace are `matrix-os`, matching the visible product name.

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add "$(pwd)"
```

After Codex refreshes the marketplace, enable **Matrix OS** (`matrix-os`) and try one of its
starter prompts:

```text
Build a new app on my Matrix computer.
Clone this GitHub repo on Matrix and make a change.
Run this command on my Matrix computer.
```

The product bundles three focused skills:

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `matrix-onboarding` | Matrix setup, authentication, diagnostics, and recovery. |
| `matrix-cloud-run` | Bounded commands and sandboxed coding-agent tasks on Matrix. |
| `matrix-github-project` | Collision-safe GitHub clone, checkout reuse, changes, and validation. |

All authentication happens through browser/device flows inside Matrix. The skills never require
copying local credential files to the cloud computer. Every remote command creates a tab in the
resolved project workspace and reports the matching `matrix shell connect --project <project>
--tab <tab-id>` command. Each additional terminal or concurrent task gets another tab.

If you installed an unpublished preview under the old `matrix-onboarding` namespace, remove that
preview and install the renamed plugin once:

```bash
codex plugin remove matrix-onboarding@matrix-os
codex plugin add matrix-os@matrix-os
```

## Move a Local Task to Matrix

The repo-scoped `matrix-handoff` skill under `.agents/skills/matrix-handoff/` safely moves the
active working tree and a continuation brief to a new project directory on the user's Matrix
computer, then starts Codex or Claude there. Claude also exposes the workflow as
`/matrix-handoff` through `.claude/commands/matrix-handoff.md`.

The workflow has two explicit phases:

1. Preview the filtered file count, optional repository-matched transcript, destination, agent,
   and a SHA-256 scope approval token.
2. After the user approves that exact scope, rerun with `--approve TOKEN`. The script stages the
   inputs again and refuses to upload if the files, brief, transcript, agent, profile, or
   destination basis changed after preview.

Common secret files, `.env` files, private keys, `.git`, dependencies, and generated output are
excluded. Use `--no-history` for a summary-only handoff that does not discover or upload a raw
agent transcript. Authentication is never copied; GitHub and the selected coding agent must use
their own browser/device flow or Matrix-managed key inside the runtime.

Example prompts:

```text
Use $matrix-handoff to move this task to Matrix with Codex, using --no-history.
/matrix-handoff --agent claude --no-history
```

## Preconfigure Agent In Matrix

Recommended target state:

1. The Matrix image includes Agent or installs it during first boot as the `matrix` user.
2. First boot runs `scripts/install-agent-matrix-skills.sh`.
3. Gateway startup runs `scripts/sync-matrix-agent-skills.sh` so Matrix, Claude Code, Codex, and Hermes see
   the same canonical skill pack.
4. Agent config sets Matrix's local gateway URL:

   ```bash
   agent config set skills.config.matrix.gateway_url http://localhost:4000
   ```

5. No Pipedream, Clerk, Gmail, GitHub, Slack, or provider secrets are written to Agent config or customer VPS env.

For production user VPSes, preinstalling Agent plus the Matrix skills is safe because the skills contain instructions only. Authenticated Matrix actions should still go through Matrix gateway/platform APIs.

For dev VPSes, also make the Agent install path writable by the `matrix` user so Agent, Codex, and Claude CLIs can self-update without `EACCES`.

## Developer CLI Bootstrap

The developer ICP should be able to sign up, receive a VPS, and let their coding agent finish setup through the same terminal primitive the web shell uses. Do not create a separate SSH-style path for interactive commands.

Document this minimal command surface for agents and humans:

```bash
matrix login --profile cloud
matrix doctor
matrix whoami
matrix status
matrix instance info --json
matrix run -it --project example -C projects/example -- git status --short
matrix run -it --project example -C projects/example -- codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox workspace-write
matrix shell list
matrix shell connect --project example --tab <tab-id>
```

`matrix run -it --project <project> -C <dir> -- <argv...>` selects an existing directory, creates a
tab in that project's Zellij workspace, starts the requested command, and attaches the local terminal
over `/ws/terminal/tab`. `-C` does not create the directory. The local terminal is a dumb TTY: stdin
is put in raw mode, Ctrl-C/Ctrl-D are forwarded to the remote process, terminal resizes are
forwarded as `resize` frames, and `Ctrl-\ Ctrl-\` detaches without killing the remote session.

Always create Matrix CLI tabs for remote commands, including readiness probes and short commands.
Each project owns one workspace; concurrent work gets another tab. Report the returned tab ID and
its `matrix shell connect --project <project> --tab <tab-id>` command immediately.

`matrix instance info --json` can return `ready: true` with `source: execution_probe` when the
management endpoint is degraded but command execution is healthy. Continue in that state, report
the degraded management plane, and retry later for full metadata. Stop only if both the management
request and execution probe fail.

Use the reserved `main` workspace for setup workflows so the user, Matrix web terminal, Claude, Codex, or Hermes can all view the same tab:

Create separate tabs for unrelated workflows and use the stable tab ID for reconnects; display names are not identities and may be duplicated.

If `matrix run -it` or `matrix shell new` fails, do not keep retrying the same command. Run
`matrix shell list`, then use `matrix shell connect --project <project> --tab <tab-id>` against an
existing tab. If creation still fails, ask the human to choose an existing tab in Matrix.

For unattended Codex work, pair `--ask-for-approval never` with `--sandbox read-only` or
`--sandbox workspace-write` and scope `-C` to the narrow target. For Claude Code, use
`claude --permission-mode auto -p <prompt>` in its own tab to avoid repetitive permission
questions while retaining Claude's safety classifier. If auto mode is unavailable, stop and report
the limitation; never fall back to a permission bypass. Never use Codex `danger-full-access`
without explicit user direction.

## Provisioning Hook

The bootstrap step should run after the Matrix runtime user exists and before the shell is presented as ready:

```bash
su - matrix -c 'if test -x /home/matrix/projects/matrix-os/scripts/install-agent-matrix-skills.sh; then cd /home/matrix/projects/matrix-os && ./scripts/install-agent-matrix-skills.sh; else echo "Matrix skills checkout not present; skipping local skill install"; fi'
su - matrix -c 'agent config set skills.config.matrix.gateway_url http://localhost:4000'
```

If the checkout is not present in `/home/matrix/projects/matrix-os`, skip the first command and install
the Matrix skills from the published source or the release-bundled skill path instead.

If Agent is not installed yet, install it into a user-writable prefix owned by `matrix`, not a root-owned global npm prefix.

## Security Boundary

The skills intentionally do not request Pipedream, Clerk, Gmail, GitHub, Slack, or provider secrets. Agent should call Matrix gateway/platform APIs with Matrix auth. Platform owns integration credentials and user connection state.

## Recommended Future Toolset

Skills are enough for instruction-heavy workflows. For reliable authenticated actions, add an Agent `matrix` toolset with:

- `matrix.list_apps`
- `matrix.read_file`
- `matrix.write_file`
- `matrix.run_app_build`
- `matrix.open_app`
- `matrix.list_integrations`
- `matrix.connect_integration`
- `matrix.call_integration`
- `matrix.get_preview_url`

The skills can then prefer those tools and fall back to shell/curl when the toolset is unavailable.
