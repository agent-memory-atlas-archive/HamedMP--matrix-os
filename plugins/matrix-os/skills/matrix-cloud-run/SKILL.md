description: Run commands and coding-agent tasks in observable Matrix OS terminal tabs. Use when a user asks to execute a command, inspect files, build a Matrix app, run validation, or perform coding work on a Matrix cloud computer.

# Run Work on Matrix OS

Use the hosted Matrix MCP tools for remote work. Authenticate HTTP connections with the coding client's browser OAuth flow; no local Matrix CLI is required. The Matrix CLI fallback has separate authentication and is only for users who choose it or clients without remote MCP support.

## MCP-first execution

1. Call `list_computers` and choose the explicit `runtimeSlot`; never guess or silently fall back to another computer.
2. Use `run_command` with the `command` argv array for short probes that need captured output. Hosted HTTP defaults to and caps commands at 45 seconds; use persistent terminals for longer work.
3. For observable or long-running work, use `create_terminal`, `create_terminal_tab` when useful, `select_terminal_tab`, and `send_terminal_input`. Report the terminal and tab names so the user can reconnect in Matrix.
4. Use `list_files`, `read_file`, `download_file`, and `upload_file` for bounded Matrix-home files. These tools never read or write arbitrary local paths.
5. Use `list_chats`, `search_chats`, and `get_chat` only when prior Matrix chat context is relevant; these tools are read-only.

For HTTP authentication failures, reconnect using `codex mcp login <configured-server-name>` or Claude Code's `/mcp` authentication flow. Do not collect tokens in chat. `matrix login` only repairs stdio/CLI authentication, not HTTP OAuth. If hosted MCP is unavailable, explain that status and offer the CLI fallback explicitly.

## CLI fallback terminal policy

- Always use `matrix run -it --project <project> ... -- <argv...>` for remote commands; use `main` outside a known project.
- When another terminal or concurrent task is needed, create another tab in the same project workspace.
- Report every returned tab ID and `matrix shell connect --project <project> --tab <tab-id>` command immediately.
- Pass prompts as command arguments after `--`; never interpolate user input into `sh -c`, `bash -lc`, substitutions, or a single shell string.

## CLI fallback readiness gate

Verify the local CLI, hosted profile, login, identity, and instance:

```bash
matrix --version
matrix profile show cloud
matrix doctor
matrix whoami
matrix status
matrix instance info --json
```

If `matrix instance info` reports `ready: true` with `source: execution_probe`, continue and report that the management plane is degraded. Treat it as unavailable only when both management and execution checks fail.

If login is missing or expired, run `matrix login --profile cloud` and let the user complete browser/device authentication. If the instance is not provisioned, use `https://app.matrix-os.com` and wait until it is ready.

Check only the selected agent in separate readiness tabs:

```bash
matrix run -it --project main -- codex --version
matrix run -it --project main -- codex login status
matrix run -it --project main -- claude --version
matrix run -it --project main -- claude auth status
```

Run only the Codex pair or Claude pair. Authenticate a disconnected agent in `auth-codex-<suffix>` or `auth-claude-<suffix>`. Never scan, read, or upload local credential files. Ask before installing a missing global tool and prefer Matrix's visible developer-tool installation path.

## Validate the destination

- Normalize a safe relative destination under the Matrix home.
- Reject empty paths, absolute paths, backslashes, control characters, and `.` or `..` segments.
- Use `apps/<slug>` for a runnable Matrix app and `projects/<name>` for ordinary work.
- Inspect an existing destination before using it and stop on conflicting contents.

Use separate observable tabs for each probe:

```bash
matrix run -it --project main -- test -e <dir>
matrix run -it --project main -- test -d <dir>
matrix run -it --project main -- ls -la <dir>
```

For a new app, create the normalized directory before selecting it:

```bash
matrix run -it --project main -- mkdir -p -- apps/<slug>
matrix run -it --project main -C apps/<slug> -- pwd
```

`-C` selects an existing directory; it never creates it. Do not pass a nonexistent path to `matrix run -C`.

## Run tasks

Create a new tab for every command:

```bash
matrix run -it --project <project> -C <dir> -- <argv...>
matrix shell connect --project <project> --tab <tab-id>
```

Observe the session through completion and report its actual command result. Never infer success from partial output or a disconnected local terminal.

For Codex inspection:

```bash
matrix run -it --project <project> -C <dir> -- codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox read-only exec -- <prompt>
```

For Codex changes:

```bash
matrix run -it --project <project> -C <dir> -- codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox workspace-write exec -- <prompt>
```

Pair unattended Codex with `--ask-for-approval never` and an explicit sandbox. Never use `danger-full-access` without explicit direction.

Run Claude without repetitive permission questions using its verified auto mode:

```bash
matrix run -it --project <project> -C <dir> -- claude --permission-mode auto -p <prompt>
```

Auto mode keeps background safety checks while minimizing clarification and permission prompts. If the installed Claude version or account does not support auto mode, report that limitation and stop; do not fall back to a permission bypass.

## Handoff

Report the normalized destination, exact argv, validation performed, changed files, outcome, every terminal reference, and every `matrix shell connect --project <project> --tab <tab-id>` command.
